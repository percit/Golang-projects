# Netsuite like app that takes workerName, date and hours worked and puts into mongoDB collection

## What works as of now:
- backend server, to run it simply us `go build -o backendServer` and  `./backendServer -m <mongoDB_key>

## What I intend to add:
- client with some frontend

## Svelte client:
- `npx create-react-app svelte-client` to create app
- `npm run dev` to run the app
